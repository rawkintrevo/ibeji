# Designing Assets

## User Flow

To design an asset template for the system the user will have to:
1. Provide CAD (or other supported) file.
1. Provide file that specifies sensor placement and how sensor data should be displayed, number of values, valid values/ranges, etc.
1. Other assosciated (user manuals, etc.). Could be text, pdf, binary, etc. 

This becomes an asset template which can be selected in the "store".
 
## CAD Files

Industry Standard(? confirm).  Will support various file formats (perhaps by converting to standard)


#### FOSS CAD Software

There are lots of options, I chose FreeCAD on my ubuntu box.

```bash
sudo apt-get install freecad
```

Note: Looks promising but spent an hour- decided to come back to this rabbit hole.
